# BiasNavi
A data bias management toolkit developed by ARC Training Centre for Information Resilience [CIRES](https://cires.org.au/)

BiasNavi aims to manage the bias in datasets. It complies with the following pipeline:

+ **Identifying**: Identify if the data or system being used is subject to bias or fairness issues. 
+ **Measuring**: Quantify with an appropriate metric the magnitude of different types of bias present in the data or system being considered. 
+ **Indexing**: Collect, parse, structure, and store bias metadata and fairness policies aimed at facilitating a subsequent fast and effective retrieval and system adaptation. 
+ **Surfacing**: Present in an appropriate way to the end user the bias present in the underlying data and/or any fairness policy that have been applied to the data or system under consideration. 
+ **Adapting**: Provide the user with a set of tools that allows them to interact with existing biased results and to adapt them for bias in their preferred ways.
